<summary>The 'extends' Keyword</summary>
The 'extends' keyword enables one class to inherit from another.

You can refer to the class which is inheriting as a child class or a subclass.

The class which is being inherited from can be referred to as a parent class or a base class.

<summary>Overriding Parent Methods</summary>
When you define a method in a child class with the same name as one in a parent class, the child class method overrides the parent method when called from the child class.

<summary>Introduction To Visibility</summary>
There are 3 visibility keywords: public, protected, and private. They are used to restrict access to properties and methods. Let's take a look at how to apply them.

<summary>Protected Properties</summary>
Protected properties can only be access in the class which define / declare them and in the sub classes which extend the defining class. They can not be accessed in any other parts of your code.
</details>

<details close>
<summary>Private Properties</summary>
Private properties can only be accessed in the class which declares / defines them. They can not be accessed anywhere else in your code.
</details>

<summary>Method Visibility</summary>
Method visibility abides by the same rules as property visibility:

public: anywhere

protected: declaring class and sub classes

private: declaring class only
